7. Wait for the cloning process to complete.

### Customizing Your Portfolio

After cloning the repository, you can start customizing your portfolio by modifying the files in the repository. Typically, you'll find HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that you can edit to add your own content, customize styles, and tweak functionality.

Feel free to explore the files and make changes according to your preferences and the content you want to showcase in your portfolio.

### Deploying Your Portfolio

Once you're satisfied with the customization, you can deploy your portfolio website to make it accessible to others. The process may vary depending on the repository and hosting platform used. Refer to the documentation provided in the repository for specific deployment instructions.
